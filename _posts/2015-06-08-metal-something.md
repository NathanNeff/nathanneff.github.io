title: Metal Something is Here

This is my first post attempting to chronicle my quest to listen to more Metal.

I intend to post frequently, basically when I hear a killer song or find a new
insane Metal band.  I *don't* intend to review the songs/bands.  For reviews, and
metal discussion, I recommend http://metal-archives.com

# The Plan:

List song, album and band members, and a link to the band's website or YouTube
of the song.

# Go!

- [Best Chant](#snarl_chant) -- Anaal Nathrakh: *"Screaming of the Unborn"*
- [Guitar Slaying](#slaying) of the week:  Solstice and Anata
- [Best Growling *and* Snarling](#growl) -- Slugathor: *Fabric of the Multiverse*
- [Mad Wack Drums](#mad)

## Anaal Nathrakh: "Screaming of the Unborn"

<a name="snarl_chant"></a>

Snarl and Tribal Chanting

* Song: "Screaming of the Unborn"
* Band: Anaal Nathrakh
* Album: (Hell is Empty and All the Devils Are Here)

The chorus in this song is great, it sounds like the "Ooga Ooga Ooga" chant.

## Guitar Slaying
<a name="slaying" ></a>

Tie this week between Solstice and Anata.  Solstice has great solos, and Anata
has some great, insane guitar riffs

* Song: Shackled to Guilt
* Artist: Anata
* Album: Under a Stone With No Inscription

* Song: Cleansed of Impurity
* Artist: Solstice
* Album: Pray for the Sentencing

## Best Growling *and* Snarling
<a name="growl"></a>

* Artist: Slugathor
* Song: "Fabric of the Multiverse"
* Album Unleashing the Slugathron

I like the play on the word "Slugathor", and I also like Slugathor's
willingness to have riff-laden songs, along with snarls, growls and guitar
solos.

<a name="mad" ></a>

* Artist: Deeds of Flesh
* Song: Reduced to Ashes
* Album: Reduced to Ashes

That's all for the start.  Look for more Metal notes soon
