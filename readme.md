# Blog README

Yet another attempt at a blog using Jekyll

# Goals

* Obviously, write content
* Understand "code"

    - Shouldn't publish a bunch of copy/pasted html/css/jekyll

* Use reasonable method of pushing content

    - Commits should be modular, independent, simple
    - Checking out any commit should produce reasonable site
